# TAL-DataVis
A small project that scrapes all of the This American Life transcripts and creates an interactive webpage. I mostly built this to learn Prisma.


## About
This project doesn’t have too much to it. Basically, I wanted to learn a new stack and figured this could be a fun way to do so. 

What you’re looking at here is a collection of visualizations built with {__INSERT LIBRARY HERE__} that play with a set of transcripts that I scraped from ThisAmericanLife.org. 

### Front-end
* Next.JS
* TailwindCSS

### Back-end
* Postgres SQL
* Node Js
* Prisma

And the crawler is just a bland python script that uses BeautifulSoup and Pandas
